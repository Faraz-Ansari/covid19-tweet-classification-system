# Covid Tweet Classification System

### The proposed system takes user input as a tweet and then classifies whether it is covid-positive or covid-negative.

### Model is trained on pre-available dataset.

### There are two main files in this repository.

-   model_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the same code as model.py. This file is there to give user the choice to run any of the two, which one user prefers.

-   covid_dataset.csv: File containing the dataset, essential for model building.

### Important points to remember:

-   User has to make sure there is internet connection available.

-   All modules that are imported in the project has to be pre-installed before running the project.

-   Model building takes few seconds especially if running for the first time or running it on an older hardware. So please be patient!
