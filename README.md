Covid Tweet Classification System

The proposed system takes user input as a tweet and then classifies whether it is covid-positive or covid-negative.
Model is trained on pre-available dataset.

There are two files in this folder.
1. model_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the same code as model.py. This file is there to give user the choice to run any of the two, which one user prefers. 

2. covid_dataset.csv: File containing the dataset, essential for model building.

Important points to remember:
1. User has to make sure there is internet connection available.

2. All modules that are imported in the project has to be pre-installed before running the project.

3. Model building takes few seconds especially if running for the first time or running it on an older hardware. So please be patient!

4. Model accuracy is almost 67%, so there is some room for incorrect predictions.
